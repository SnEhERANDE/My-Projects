This is my first ever project on github so if there are any mistakes please tell me i am learning
About Login System - 
there is only one user in the login system default called admin. his user name and password are in a image of zip file.
you can use that to login and add manger or normal user. 

normal user can -
login and log out this is the only thing normal user can do.

manger user can -
login and log out, add normal user, add manger, add leave for a user, see logs of people, see leaves of people.

admin is actully a manger.
all the passwords are encrypted.
this only works on one machine.
i didn't find how to come back from a screen so there is now option called back anywere in the system i will try to find it.
evrything is saved in files.

zip file containes .EXE file if you don't have python you can use that zip file!!!
